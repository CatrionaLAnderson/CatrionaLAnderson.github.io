            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Catriona Anderson. I have just finished my Electronic Engineering and Creative Computing degree at Queen Mary University, and I’m super excited to dive into some real-world projects and start working with interesting people. This September, I’ll be starting a Master’s in Human-Computer Interaction at UCL to further explore my interest in user experience and research.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m a creative person at heart, and I love finding new ways to approach problems and come up with solutions that actually make a difference. I’m also a bit of a people person — I love chatting with others, hearing their perspectives, and figuring out how to make things better for them. At the same time, I’ve got a pretty logical mindset, so I’m good at breaking down problems and working through them step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my favorite parts of my degree has been exploring Human-Computer Interaction and learning about theories like distributed cognition and phenomenology. It’s been so interesting to understand how people interact with technology and how little changes can make a big difference in the user experience. I also really love digging into research and figuring out what people actually need, even when they’re not totally sure how to put it into words.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m really keen to get involved in some exciting projects where I can bring both my creative and analytical sides together. I love work that involves a mix of people-focused tasks and structured, thoughtful problem-solving — especially when it’s research-based. I know I’ve got a knack for figuring out what users or customers are missing and coming up with practical ways to meet those needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can’t wait to start working with real companies and get stuck into some hands-on, impactful projects. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat!
